Hypervigilance is something that I've dealt with before with my children, both of whose sensory systems tend to go into overdrive in any situation that is new or even a little stressful. But reading this helped me make the connection between hypervigilance and how I'm consuming social media right now, as well as how I watched the news after 9/11.
