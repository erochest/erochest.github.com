title: Hypervigilance
---

The morning of September 11, 2001, I was in graduate school, doing what graduate student do. I was at home on my computer, either working, researching, writing, or more likely procrastinating. The radio was on. The morning announcer broke in to say that someone had flown a plane into the World Trade Center. I thought, *Some idiot in a [Cessna][cessna].* That was all. For a minute I moved on.

Then my curiosity was piqued, and I got up, moved across the room, and flipped on the TV, just in case anything was on there.

I don't feel like I moved for three days.

And that's not true, strictly speaking. Of course, life went on. Sleep, waking, meals, work, classes. But I do remember being a bit stuck. If there wasn't a TV nearby, part of me was wondering what was on, what was happening, had something new and horrible occurred.

My daughter is known for keeping track of everyone in a group. Where they are. What they're doing. When she was three, my partner and she attended a couple of mommy-and-me sessions at the local Waldorf school, and the teacher quickly learned that she could take role by asking my daughter who was missing.

This is kind of cute, until she's tracking people who matter to her. My mother left a family reunion early once, and my daughter wasn't aware of it. Suddenly she started freaking out because she didn't know where Meme was.

Around transitions, my son jumps at the slightest sound: "What's that?" No one else has heard anything. Then we'll realize, oh yes, there was a sound. A car went by on the road. A branch blew against a window. The house creaked. One of the thousands of sounds that fill our days that our brains usually tell us we don't need to pay attention to.

The other day my partner mentioned that she wanted to take a walk, and for the rest of the day my son kept coming up randomly asking when she was going to take a walk, on high alert so that she didn't just disappear on him.

Lately I've been checking Twitter, checking Facebook, checking the news like a rat on cocaine.

IANAN (I am not a neurologist), but:

Both of my kids are adopted, and one effect of those early, traumatic transitions can be that the brain is flooded [cortisol][cortisol] and other chemicals at an early age when brain plasticity is high. In a sense, their brains become wired to fear more quickly and easily than they would had their background been more stable and nurturing.

We talk a lot in our house about upstairs brain (prefrontal cortex) and downstairs brain (brainstem).

I recently ran across a Twitter thread by [Corey Alexander][twitter] on [strategies for managing hypervigilance][thread].

<div class="storify"><iframe src="//storify.com/TGStoneButch/dailycoping-strategies-for-managing-hypervigilance/embed?header=false&border=false&template=slideshow" width="100%" height="750" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><script src="//storify.com/TGStoneButch/dailycoping-strategies-for-managing-hypervigilance.js?header=false&border=false&template=slideshow"></script><noscript>[<a href="//storify.com/TGStoneButch/dailycoping-strategies-for-managing-hypervigilance" target="_blank">View the story "#DailyCoping-strategies for managing hypervigilance" on Storify</a>]</noscript></div>

Hypervigilance is something that I've dealt with before with my children, both of whose sensory systems tend to go into overdrive in any situation that is new or even a little stressful. But reading this helped me make the connection between hypervigilance and how I'm consuming social media right now, as well as how I watched the news after 9/11.

This thread brought a lot of these things together. Getting stuck in front of the TV/Twitter/Facebook is a fear response.

[*Fear is the mind killer.*][litany] When you're in fight/flight/freeze mode, you're not thinking, you're reacting. Your executive functions have shut down and you're essentially reacting like an animal.

This sometimes reminds me of Star Trek. When the Enterprise has been hit and is under attack, what happens? The captain yells, "Divert all power to the shields." (I assume power keeps going to life support systems.) Lights go down on the bridge.

That's more or less what happens in the brain. Your prefrontal cortex is slow and takes a lot of energy. If humans had needed to rely on it for survival, we'd be dead as a species. Lizards don't think about their reactions, but boy are they fast. They stay alive.

So when the amygdala thinks there's a threat, it diverts power away from the prefrontal cortex and pours energy into the sympathetic nervous system.

I used to think of the freeze response as being one of the stupidest things imaginable.

But since then I've watched my cat chase down lots of spiders. Which ones survive? The ones who freeze. Her eyes are made to pay attention to movement. Her brain is wired to track down things that run. If a spider sits very still, she often loses interest. She doesn't quite stop seeing it, but she gets bored and wanders off easily.

*Fear is the mind killer.*

When we're afraid, it's not that we're making bad decisions, it's that we're not making decisions. We're reacting.

Our neurochemistry is designed to keep us alive for all sorts of immediate threats. But it will kill us if we have to live that way.

I've been trying to figure out how to engage the news cycles, my Twitter feed, my Facebook timeline. I suspect this will be an ongoing balancing act, that I'll be making constant corrections.

One thing that this has made me aware of is the intense fragility of privilege. By that, I mean lots of things: that privilege can be destroyed easily, that those who are privileged feel threatened easily, and that those who are privileged have little resilience and resources for dealing with those threats.

I've seen several people of color rolling their eyes at all the white people complaining about how exhausted they are. And they should roll their eyes. And we are often trying to figure out how to live in the world people of color were born into.

But yeah, at the end of the day, we are a bit much.

I recently came across ["A Brief for the Defense"][brief] by Jack Gilbert. It so well captured how life is a balancing act between tragedy and comedy. That we must make room for delight in the midst of misery.
