title: Hope

I ran across this quote the other day listening to an
[On Being interview with Joanna Macy](https://onbeing.org/programs/joanna-macy-a-wild-love-for-the-world/
), and it reminded me about several separate discussions I've had over
the last year with several people about *hope*. The discussions were
overlapping, but isolated, and each nuanced very differently,
depending on who I was talking with.

For some reason this quote seemed to wrap up these conversations and
particularly to resonate for the place where we are as a country, as
well as where I am as an individual.

> **MS. MACY**: ... I’m not insisting that we be brimming with
> hope. It’s OK not to be optimistic. Buddhist teachings say feeling
> that you have to maintain hope can wear you out. So just be present.
>
> **MS. TIPPETT**: [laughs] That’s good. Yes.
> 
> **MS. MACY**: The biggest gift you can give is to be absolutely
> present, and when you’re worrying about whether you’re hopeful, or
> hopeless, or pessimistic, or optimistic, who cares? The main thing
> is that you’re showing up, that you’re here, and that you’re finding
> ever more capacity to love this world because it will not be healed
> without that. That was what is going to unleash our intelligence and
> our ingenuity and our solidarity for the healing of our world.
