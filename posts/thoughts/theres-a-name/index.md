title: ! 'There\''s a Name for It: Disenfranchised Grief'
---

Through Twitter, I ran across a new-to-me blog, [Adoptee Reflections][reflections]. She mentions and footnotes *disenfranchised grief*. The short version is that this is a grief that isn't recognized by others or by society, which complicates the grieving process. Often this is because what you're grieving isn't a death.

Thinking about this, I realized that some of the most difficult things I've grieved, and some of the most difficult times of my life, have been wrapped up with disenfranchised grief. I've realized that grief that others don't recognize or that others discount can be some of the most difficult to work though, but haven't realized that it had a name. (Although in retrospect, I should have. Everything has a name.)

acknowledge, make room for, but don't add to

there's something else i'm forgetting that i want to say about grief

and disen

it's hard

don't want to make it about me. need to make room for my children's grief, recognized or not, but also make room for others' grief. and recognize and make room for my own wherever it comes from
