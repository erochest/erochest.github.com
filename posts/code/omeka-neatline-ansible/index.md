At the Scholars' Lab, we're big big advocates of Open Source. All of our
projects are available freely and openly on [Github][gh], and we're always more
than happy to accept pull requests. We'd like to be able to empower everyone to
contribute to our projects as much as they're able to and comfortable with.

Unfortunately, one of our flagship projects, [Neatline][nl], isn't easy to
contribute to. There are a number of reasons for this, but one is that the
development environment is not trivial to get set up. In order to address this
and make it easier for others to contribute, we've developed an
[Ansible][ansible] playbook that takes a not-quite-stock Mac and sets up an
instance of Omeka with the Neatline plugin available, as well as all the tools
necessary for working on Neatline.

[Ansible][ansible] is a system for setting up and configuring systems. It's
often used to set up multiple serversâ€”for instance, a database server and a
static web server, both working with a dynamic web applications deployed on
several computers. If you're familiar with [Chef][chef] or [Puppet][puppet],
Ansible solves the same problems. In this case, we'll use it to configure our
local development workstation.

We've published these playbooks on [Github][gh] in the [`neatline.dev`
repository, on the `mac-ansible` branch][nldev]. You can get this by cloning it
to your local machine. (Since this is for getting started developing Neatline,
I assume that you're already comfortable with [git][git]. If not, [there][git1]
[are][git2] [lots][git3] [of][git4] [great][git5] [tutorials][git6].)

```bash
$ git clone --branch mac-ansible https://github.com/erochest/neatline.dev.git
```

## Requirements

In creating this, I've aimed for starting from a stock Mac. And I missed pretty
badly. However, the necessary prerequisites are minimal. You'll just need to
have these things installed.

* [XCode][xcode]
* [Homebrew][brew]

Once those two are on your machine, you can install the other two dependencies.
These are available through [Homebrew][brew]. So open Terminal and type these
lines:

```bash
$ brew install python
$ brew install ansible
```

That's all. You should be ready to go.

## Settings

This project includes a number settings that you can change to customize your
installation. Those are found in the file [`playbook.yaml`][playbook]. The
relevant section is labelled `vars`, and it allows you to set information about
the Omeka database (`omeka_db_user`, `omeka_db_password`, and `omeka_db_name`),
which version of Omeka you wish to use (`omeka_version`), where you wish to
install it (`omeka_dir`), and where you want to point your browser to
(`dev_hostname`) as you're working on the site. The defaults are:

```yaml
vars:
  db_user: root
  db_password:
  omeka_db_user: omeka
  omeka_db_password: omeka
  omeka_db_name: omeka
  dev_hostname: omeka-neatline.dev
  omeka_dir: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/omeka/neatlinedev"
  omeka_version: stable-2.1
  debug: true
  neatline_repo: git@github.com:scholarslab/Neatline.git
  php_version: 55
```

Change these to reflect what you'd like your personal Omeka/Neatline
installation to look like.

One option that I'll call out in particular is `neatline_repo`. This is the git
repository that you'll be working with. If you're using github to host your
project, you can [fork][fork] the primary Neatline repository (from the URL
given above). And when you've completed your work, if you'd like to contribute
back, you can send us a [pull request][pullrequest] through the Github site.

## Setting Up

Finally, we're ready to actually create the system. This is quite easy. In the
Terminal, from the `neatline.dev` directory, run the `neatline-dev` script.

```bash
$ cd neatline.dev
$ ./neatline-dev
```

Now wait.

After your computer whirs away for a while, you'll get your prompt back. When
that happens, you should be able to point your browser to
http://omeka-neatline.dev (in the example above). There you'll see the Omeka
installation form.

## What Just Happened?

The Ansible playbook does a number of tasks.

1. It installs all the dependencies that you'll need, including [PHP][phpnet],
[NodeJS][node], and [MySQL][mysql].
1. It sets MySQL to start automatically when you log in, and it creates the
Omeka MySQL user and database.
1. It configures [Apache][apache] to work with PHP and to find your Omeka
directory.
1. It downloads and configures [Omeka][omeka] and turns on debugging.
1. It clones [Neatline][nl] into Omeka's `plugin` directory.
1. It initializes [git flow][flow] for working in Neatline and leaves you on
the `develop` branch.
1. And it installs the necessary JavaScript and PHP tools, including
   [Grunt][grunt], [Bower][bower], [Composer][composer], and
   [PHPUnit][phpunit].

After all that, it really needs a break.

You probably do too.

## Future

Unfortunately, that's only the first step that we need to take to make the
Neatline code-base approachable. Some more things that we have planned include:

* Documentation on all the moving parts.
* Documentation on the overall architecture of Neatline.
* Documentation on the code. What's where? If you wish to change something,
  where would you find it?

As we get those parts in place, we'll keep you posted.
