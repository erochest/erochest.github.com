Four years is a long time. Eight years is longer.

<!--more-->

Both those time spans are easy to wrap our heads around, though. The truth is that most of us will be dead before the world sees the kind of society we want to live in.

This isn't a sprint. It's not even a marathon. It's a multigenerational migration.

I'll be posting links to more humor, trying my hand at more fiction. I'll be trying to listen to those who've worked these fields before me.

Pace yourself.

I was going to pull a quote or two from each of these links, but they're both just so good. At some point this week I'm going to highlight quotes I like from the transcripts of these on [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/). Those will probably show up again on this blog in some form.
