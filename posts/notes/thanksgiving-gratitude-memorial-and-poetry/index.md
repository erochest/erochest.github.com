I'm a bit conflicted by this holiday.

<!--more-->

On the one hand, the original day of "Thanksgiving" was a celebration of a [massacre](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-greener/the-true-story-of-thanksg_b_788436.html), and the original pilgrims aren't all they are sometimes [cracked up to be](https://www.manataka.org/page269.html). We cannot forget this.

But I'm all for gratitude.

So threaded around turkey and football, I attempt to hold our past in reverent memory while finding things to be grateful for the present.

And I pray that both the memory of the past and gratitude of the present will guide us into a better future.

Some poems to be grateful for today:

* [Three Gratitudes](http://www.onbeing.org/blog/carrie-newcomer-three-gratitudes/8902) by Carrie Newcomer.
* [Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude](http://www.caapp.pitt.edu/content/ross-gay-reads-title-poem-catalog-unabashed-gratitude) by Ross Gay.
