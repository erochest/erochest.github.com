It reminded me of these lines from the Wendell Berry poem [Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front](http://www.onbeing.org/program/program-passover-and-easter/feature/manifesto-mad-farmer-liberation-front/561) (the quote on the bottom of each page is also from this poem):

> Expect the end of the world. Laugh.<br/>
> Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful<br/>
> though you have considered all the facts.<br/>

Just as I'm trying to be mindful of beauty, I'd like to be attuned to small acts of resistance and acts of resistance that improve day-to-day life.

But I also must challenge myself not to rest there, but to push toward more direct and obvious resistance as well.
