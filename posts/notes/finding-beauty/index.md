For the past few months, I've cultivated an intentional practice to look for beauty in life.

Partially I'm trying to be more aware of things around me and their beauty. It's an amazing, fucked up world.

Wading through email is typically not beautiful. So I've subscribed to a couple of email lists that help that. Whenever I open one of these, I take a minute to be present to whatever's inside.

* [Writer's Almanac](http://writersalmanac.org/) sends me a poem each day. There's a nice variety of anthology-poetry and newer poetry, although my impression is that it does tend toward less experimental poetry.
* [StoryPeople](http://www.storypeople.com/) sends a drawing and short-short-short story each day. Usually they're a joyful little interruption from life.

I'm curious where others look for beauty. Feel free to send me suggestions on Twitter or Facebook, and I'll post some that stand out to me here.
