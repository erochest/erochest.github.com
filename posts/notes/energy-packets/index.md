Some random thoughts, not about the news, but of course that's the context.

[*Vulnerability hangover*][vulnerability]. It's a thing. But it's also kind of the point of the post, no?

For my next longer post I'm thinking about the words and metaphors I used in my [last post][divisions].

As I sat meditating this morning, the sun came out from behind a building. I know because I felt my cheek warm and saw the light through my eyelids. And it occurred to me that those packets/waves of energy had travelled 8 light-minutes from a huge ball of fire. Most of the packets/waves that leave that inferno spin off into darkness. Some got scattered by the atmosphere and the glass/plastic window. Yet still there was enough left that it moved the molecules in my skin.

It is an amazing universe we live in. Fucked up, yes. But amazing.

Finally: Yes, I will do something about all the mushroom pictures.

Also, some good links my partner has sent on talking to kids about the outcome of the election:
