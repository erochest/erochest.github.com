title: The Long Haul
---

I mentioned back in ["Pace Yourself"][pace] that this is going to be a long
four years. Lately, particularly after this first week, it really, really
feels like it.

I've been thinking over ["How to #StayOutraged Without Losing Your Mind"][outraged] a lot lately as I've been watching this dumpster fire. This is a great resource. How does this become "normal" without reacting to it as normal?

One thing I'm trying to do is to look at the situation from all sides. I'm partway through [*Parable of the Sower*][sower] by Octavia E. Butler. It's a good pick. It feels right for the moment.

But next I think I'm going to read [*Man's Search for Meaning*][meaning] by Viktor E. Frankl. (I wonder if they have the same middle name?) I need to remember that those situations where people are at their worse are also the situations where people are at their best.

A couple of thoughts from the "#StayOutraged" post: Look away. We don't want our eyes to get used to this.

And it mentions using one of the daily action lists that are going around as a way to make engaging easy. (If anyone has a favorite, please send it to me, and I'll list it here.)

* [Daily Action][dailyaction] Texts you an issue every day that you can call and speak out to a legislator on.

It seems like looking away and daily action can work together. I'm more likely to give myself permission to look away if I am intentionally doing something small every day. It also mentioned that these lists can help make doing something fun.

Speaking of fun, I'll leave you with this list of ["Concrete Actions Progressives Can Take During Trumpâ€™s Presidency."][actions] Ouch.
