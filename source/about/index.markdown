Welcome to my spot on the web. This is has information about myself, about some
of the projects I've done in the past, about and those I'm working on now.

my personal life.</p>

I am interested in a lot of things that many people find odd: technology,
computers, programming, writing, language, lexicography, literature, the Middle
Ages. I have a PhD in English, but I'm currently working as a computer
programmer. 

My interests tend to float around the intersection of those topics. I enjoy
creating toys to slice, dice, and analyze language and texts, and I enjoy
thinking and writing about them.

But beyond that, things get foggy.

At various points in my life, I have been a writer, computer programmer,
computational/corpus linguist, and literary critic. Like a crazy person, I
still try to do all of them to some extent. As
[John Maeda says](http://weblogs.media.mit.edu/SIMPLICITY/archives/000228.html),
when faced with a choice, *do both*.

It makes for a very harried life.
