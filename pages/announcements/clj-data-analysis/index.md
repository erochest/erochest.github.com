I'm pleased to announce the release of the [*Clojure Data Analysis
Cookbook*][packtclj], written by me, and published by [Packt
Publishing][packt].

This book has practical recipes for every stage of the data analysis process:

* acquiring data,
* cleaning it,
* analyzing it,
* displaying and graphing it, and
* publishing it on the web.

There's also a chapter on statistics and one on machine learning, as well as
the obligatory (for Clojure, anyway) chapters on parallelism and concurrency.

From the book's blurb:

> Data is everywhere and it's increasingly important to be able to gain
> insights that we can act on. Using Clojure for data analysis and collection,
> this book will show you how to gain fresh insights and perspectives from your
> data with an essential collection of practical, structured recipes.
> 
> "The Clojure Data Analysis Cookbook" presents recipes for every stage of the
> data analysis process. Whether scraping data off a web page, performing data
> mining, or creating graphs for the web, this book has something for the task at
> hand.
> 
> You'll learn how to acquire data, clean it up, and transform it into useful
> graphs which can then be analyzed and published to the Internet. Coverage
> includes advanced topics like processing data concurrently, applying powerful
> statistical techniques like Bayesian modelling, and even data mining algorithms
> such as K-means clustering, neural networks, and association rules.

I've enjoyed writing this. It's been a fun journey, and the people I've been
working with on this have been awesome.

Over the next few weeks, I'll post a few of the recipes that I started on, but
which I had to cut for space or other reasons. They'll give you a taste of
what's available for you in this book, so look for them in the upcoming weeks!
