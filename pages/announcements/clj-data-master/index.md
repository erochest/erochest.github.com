After a few delays, I'm pleased to announce the release of [*Mastering Clojure
Data Analysis*][packt].

This book is a case study of ten different data analysis topics using Clojure.
It discusses an assortment of techniques in data analysis and machine learning,
and it uses a number of Clojure and Java libraries.

To give you a taste of what it covers, here is the table of contents:

1. Network Analysis – The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
1. GIS Analysis – Mapping Climate Change
1. Topic Modeling – Changing Concerns in the State of the Union Addresses
1. Classifying UFO Sightings
1. Benford's Law – Detecting Natural Progressions of Numbers
1. Sentiment Analysis – Categorizing Hotel Reviews
1. Null Hypothesis Tests – Analyzing Crime Data
1. A/B Testing – Statistical Experiments for the Web
1. Analyzing Social Data Participation
1. Modeling Stock Data

And from the book's blurb:

> Mastering Clojure Data Analysis teaches you how to analyze and visualize
> complex datasets. With this book, you'll learn how to perform data analysis
> using established scientific methods with the modern, powerful Clojure
> programming language with the help of exciting examples drawn from real-world
> data. This will help you get to grips with advanced topics such as network
> analysis, the characteristics of social networks, applying topic modeling to
> get a handle on unstructured textual data, and GIS analysis to apply
> geospatial techniques to your data analysis problems.
>
> With this guide, you'll learn how to leverage the power and flexibility of
> Clojure to dig into your data and access the insights it hides.

If you're interested, feel free to check this book out on [Packt's
website][packt] or on [Amazon][amazon].

Although I also do this in the book, I'd like to take a minute to thank the
editorial team at Packt that worked with me. The reviewers were also
invaluable. They put a lot of effort into helping me see where the very rough
first draft needed more attention. Any shortcomings still in the book are
entirely my own.

And most of all, I'd like to thank my family. They put up with my being only
partially available during some rough times, and I appreciate their patience,
understanding, support, and love.

Sometime during the next week, I'll set up a page with some of the datasets for
the book. Watch this space.
