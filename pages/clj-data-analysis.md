I'm pleased to announce the release of the [*Clojure Data Analysis
Cookbook*][packtclj], written by me, and published by [Packt
Publishing][packt].

This book has practical recipes for every stage of the data analysis process,
from acquiring data, to cleaning it, to analyzing it, to displaying and
graphing it, and to publishing it on the web. There's a chapter on statistics
and one on machine learning, as well as the obligatory (for Clojure, anyway)
chapters on parallelism and concurrency.

From the book's blurb:

> Data is everywhere and it's increasingly important to be able to gain
> insights that we can act on. Using Clojure for data analysis and collection,
> this book will show you how to gain fresh insights and perspectives from your
> data with an essential collection of practical, structured recipes.
> 
> "The Clojure Data Analysis Cookbook" presents recipes for every stage of the
> data analysis process. Whether scraping data off a web page, performing data
> mining, or creating graphs for the web, this book has something for the task at
> hand.
> 
> You'll learn how to acquire data, clean it up, and transform it into useful
> graphs which can then be analyzed and published to the Internet. Coverage
> includes advanced topics like processing data concurrently, applying powerful
> statistical techniques like Bayesian modelling, and even data mining algorithms
> such as K-means clustering, neural networks, and association rules.

I've enjoyed writing this, although right now I'm mainly looking forward to
doing something else for a while. I'm making a list.

Over the next few weeks, I'll post a few of the recipes that I started on, but
which I had to cut for space or other reasons. They'll give you a taste of
what's available for you in this book.
